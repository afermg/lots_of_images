#+TITLE: Tools for dealing with large images
Collection of tools to deal with large and/or many images

* Zenodo partitioner and uploader
Upload multiple time lapse experiments to Zenodo.
```
- root
  - experiment1
    - metadata1_Acq.txt
    - metadata2_log.txt
      ...
    - site1.zarr
    - site2.zarr
      ...
  - experiment2
    ...
  - split_under_50G.awk
  - dirs_to_zenodo.sh
```
    

1. Make sure that the metadata files are found at the top
#+begin_src bash
   for i in $(find */*.txt);d do
     mv $i "$(dirname $i)/0_$(basename $i)";
   done
#+end_src
   
2. List file sizes and files; sort by name
#+begin_src bash
  find . -mindepth 2 -maxdepth 2 -exec du -m {} + | sort -k2 > files.txt  
#+end_src

3. Partition experiment files based on file size
#+begin_src awk
  awk -f split_under_50G.awk > batched_files.txt
#+end_src

4. Upload files and create a manifest.csv file
#+begin_src bash
  bash dirs_to_zenodo.sh batched_files.txt | tee upload_log.txt
#+end_src

* Test multiple encoders to minimise space footprint
- Image compression codecs (so far bzip seems to outperform them)
